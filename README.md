# Profit Dashboard

This project requires several environment variables for external integrations. Below are credentials used by the `app:shopify:orders:create` command:

- `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` – the full domain of your Shopify store (e.g. `example.myshopify.com`).
- `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` – the Admin API access token for that store.

Set these variables in `.env.local` or your deployment environment before running the command.
